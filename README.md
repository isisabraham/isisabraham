# Hello 👋 Welcome!

I’m Isa, a **CRM & Digital Marketing professional** focused on **customer journeys**, **lifecycle strategies**, and **marketing execution**.

This repository showcases projects related to:

**Customer Journey Mapping** – real-life CRM applications and process optimization
**CRM & Lifecycle Marketing** – customer engagement, retention, and communication flows
**Email Marketing (HTML)** – responsive emails for seasonal and promotional campaigns

One of the main projects featured here is a **customer journey mapping project developed** for Bagaggio, based on a real business scenario. The journey was mapped using **Miro** to visualize customer touchpoints, identify gaps, and improve processes and lifecycle communications.

I also create responsive HTML email templates for campaigns such as Black Friday and Back to School, focusing on structure, clarity, and cross-device usability.

## 📌 Note: Some projects and documentation are written in Portuguese because they were created for real companies and stakeholders in Brazil. The focus is on CRM strategy, methodology, and practical application, not language.

📌 Currently focused on growing my career in **CRM, Lifecycle Marketing, and Customer Experience**.

🔗 Feel free to explore the projects below or connect with me.
